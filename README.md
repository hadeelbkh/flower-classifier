# flower-classifier
This project utilizes Python and TensorFlow to build a machine learning model for classifying flowers into 102 distinct classes. The project leverages TensorFlowâ€™s pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for feature extraction, with a custom classifier added on top to fine-tune the model for the specific task of flower classification.
